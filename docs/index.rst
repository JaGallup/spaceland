Spaceland: access shapefiles in Python
======================================

Spaceland is a modern Python library for fast, Pythonic access to `ESRI shapefiles`_.

Or, at least, that's what it *will* be. While Spaceland is in active development it's still early days and the library isn't yet feature-complete. What it does support is reading dBase III files (for why this is important, see :doc:`shapefiles`).

Spaceland is `developed on GitHub`_ and contributions are welcome.
